# hotpresidents.com
Built in Next / React. Forked from Rust + Airtable implementation. 

Uses firebase to update vote counts. 

Please feel free to make pull requests to data/presidents.json if you see any fixes, want to add folks, or update some of the content (might not accept all changes, but feel free to ask!)

Many thanks to @lbrindze for building the initial site version in Rust. Original Rust + Airtable implementation is here: https://www.github.com/lbrindze/hotpresidents.com
